Architecture of this package:
This back-propagation (ANN) implementation is designed to handle two inputs and produce a single output.


The width (number of nodes) of the single hidden layer can be configured accordingly.

The example demo of this ANN is to predict the function output of:
(5sinx) + 2y^2 with a range from 1 to 10 for both inputs.


Requried packages include: numpy, pandas, csv

The normalization method of this specific implementation is to use the min-max method.


Several functions declared in the Generic_Neural_Network class are depicted below:
 
    forward(self, X): Take in X and progpagate through the network in a feed-forward fashion.
    
    sigmoid(self, s): Calculate the sigmoid value of parameter s.
    
    sigmoidPrime(self, s): Calculate the derivative of the sigmoid function with parameter s.
    
    backward(self, X, y, o): Calculate deltas and adjust weights.
    
    train(self, X, y): Define the flow of network.
